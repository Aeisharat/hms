<p>We have seen a standing-order payment from <?php echo $member['name'] . ' [' . $member['email'] . ']'; ?> and should now e-mail them to organise access to the space. Their gatekeeper PIN is <?php echo $pin; ?>. Please notify the other member admins if you're going to be the one to contact the new member.</p>
