<p>
	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for becoming a member of Nottingham Hackspace. Here are all of the remaining details you need, though there's one last step before you'll have full 24 hour access.
</p>

<p>
	GateKeeper is our RFID entry system, for which you need a suitable card set up. If you have a CityCard, Nottingham Library card, or Oyster Card, it will work with it, otherwise, we have blank RFIDs for a Â£1 deposit. Please contact your member admin, <?php echo $this->Text->autoLinkEmails( $adminName . ' (' . $adminEmail . ') ' ); ?>, to arrange a meeting, or visit on the next open hack night and ask people to point you to one of the team.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a PDF hackspace manual:<br>
	<?php echo $manLink; ?>
</p>

<p>
	In terms of access, the street door code is <?php echo $outerDoorCode; ?>, and all other doors, including the doors in the stairwell and studio, are <?php echo $innerDoorCode; ?>. Obviously, please do not share these with non-members.
</p>

<p>
Wifi access:<br>
SSID: <?php echo $wifiSsid; ?><br>
Pass: <?php echo $wifiPass; ?><br>
